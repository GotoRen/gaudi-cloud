# Gaudi Cloud:

This development will contribute to the Gaudi repository.

In this repository, the Gaudi cloud will be built on a Kuberntes (K8s) cluster.

Our implementation will be based on a declarative configuration, which will allow developers to improve their operations and ensure continuous reliable operation.
